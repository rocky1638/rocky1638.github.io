# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        g = defaultdict(list)
        ind = Counter()
        for a, b in prerequisites:
            # create graph adjacency list
            g[a].append(b)
            # count indegrees for each node
            ind[b] += 1
        
        # push all nodes with indegree 0 into a queue
        q = deque()
        topsort = []
        for node in range(numCourses):
            if ind[node] == 0:
                q.append(node)
        
        # do bfs, but only push new nodes that have
        #   an indegree of 0 (all prereqs met)
        # decrement indegree as you go
        while q:
            cur = q.popleft()
            topsort.append(cur)
            for neighbor in g[cur]:
                ind[neighbor] -= 1
                if ind[neighbor] == 0:
                    q.append(neighbor)
        
        return len(topsort) == numCourses
```

- standard [[topological-sort]].
- a prerequisite course has a directed edge towards the course that requires it.
