# 212. Word Search II

Given an `m x n` `board` of characters and a list of strings `words`, return _all words on the board_.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        WORD_KEY = '$'
        
        trie = {}
        for word in words:
            node = trie
            for letter in word:
                # retrieve the next node; If not found, create a empty node.
                node = node.setdefault(letter, {})
            # mark the existence of a word in trie node
            node[WORD_KEY] = word
        
        rowNum = len(board)
        colNum = len(board[0])
        
        matchedWords = []
        
        def backtracking(row, col, parent):    
            
            letter = board[row][col]
            currNode = parent[letter]
            
            # check if we find a match of word
            word_match = currNode.pop(WORD_KEY, False)
            if word_match:
                # also we removed the matched word to avoid duplicates,
                #   as well as avoiding using set() for results.
                matchedWords.append(word_match)
            
            # Before the EXPLORATION, mark the cell as visited 
            board[row][col] = '#'
            
            # Explore the neighbors in 4 directions, i.e. up, right, down, left
            for (rowOffset, colOffset) in [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]:
                newRow, newCol = row + rowOffset, col + colOffset     
                if newRow < 0 or newRow >= rowNum or newCol < 0 or newCol >= colNum:
                    continue
                if not board[newRow][newCol] in currNode:
                    continue
                backtracking(newRow, newCol, currNode)
        
            # End of EXPLORATION, we restore the cell
            board[row][col] = letter
        
            # Optimization: incrementally remove the matched leaf node in Trie.
            if not currNode:
                parent.pop(letter)

        for row in range(rowNum):
            for col in range(colNum):
                # starting from each of the cells
                if board[row][col] in trie:
                    backtracking(row, col, trie)
        
        return matchedWords    
```

- we create a trie to store the list of words that we’re trying to search for.
- for each cell in the matrix, if it is the start of a word, we bfs starting from it to try to find a matching word.

table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
