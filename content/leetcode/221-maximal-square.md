# 221. Maximal Square

## Dynamic programming matrix

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        """
        - dp is a matrix with the same dimensions as matrix
        - dp[i][j] stores the side length of the biggest one square anchored bottom-right at matrix[i][j]
        - iterate from top-left, going right, then down
        - at each index, check the min square anchored at (i, j-1), (i-1, j), and (i-1, j-1)

        """

        dp = [[0]*len(matrix[0]) for row in matrix]
        best = 0
        # base case bottom row and right column

            dp[0][i] = int(matrix[0][i])

                    dp[i][j] = int(matrix[i][j])
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(
                        dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]
                    ) + 1

```

- pretty cool [[geometry]] and [[dynamic-programming]] problem.
- we can figure out the maximum sized square anchored at the top corner of some index by looking at the biggest squares that are anchored at the other three quadrants.

- in this example, we see that given the three squares of side length 2, 3, and 4 from the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants, we are able to create a square of side length $2+1=3$ from our top-left corner.

## Slight optimization.

    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:

        - return max(dp)
        """

        prev = [int(x) for x in matrix[0]]
        best = max(prev)
        
        for i in range(1, len(matrix)):
            next_row = [int(x) for x in matrix[i]]
            for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
                if matrix[i][j] == "0":
                    next_row[j] = 0
                elif j == 0:
                    next_row[j] = int(matrix[i][j])
                else:
                    next_row[j] = min(
                        next_row[j-1], prev[j], prev[j-1]
                    ) + 1
                best = max(best, next_row[j])
            prev = next_row
        return best ** 2
```

- we only ever need to read the values from the previous row of the `dp` array, so we can optimize for space by just keeping track of the current and previous rows.
