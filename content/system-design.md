## book and course notes

- [[designing-data-intensive-applications]] - A very comprehensive and in-depth look at all aspects of creating a large-scale distributed system.
- [[system-design-primer]] - A higher-level overview of system design concepts from a Github guide.
- [[system-design-interview-an-insiders-guide-by-alex-yu]] - A lightweight overview of system design concepts, more focused on practical interview topics.
- [[cs75-scalability-lecture]] - An intro lecture to scalability.

## tech blogs

- [[tech-blog-readings]] - A collection of tech blogs that I’ve read and highlighted/taken notes on.

## interviews

![Steps to take during a system design interview](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-system-design-resources/raw/main/diagrams/interview-template.png)

1. Gather functional requirements through suggestions and questions. Who is the customer, use cases, etc.
2. If applicable, discuss system restraints. What is out-of-scope?
3. Do back-of-envelope estimations when they’re necessary to inform a decision.
	- This includes estimating request throughput, data storage.
4. Think about high-level API requirements to guide your thoughts. What HTTP requests will a user realistically need to hit?
5. Sketch out a high-level system design, that can cover the main non-functional components, making sure to justify decisions and only add details when necessary!
6. Think about a couple database tables that are relevant to the solution; pick a database technology at this time.
7. Before talking about scaling, perfect the design for a single user, making sure all the functional requirements are achieved.
8. Talk about scaling. Discuss non-functional requirements and trade-offs when making decisions.
	- Find bottlenecks and SPoF’s.
9. Walk through your design like it’s code. Address failure scenarios if there is time.

**Meta tips:**

- Start with a naive solution, then go through functional, non-functional requirements to find where the solution breaks down.
	- Iterate over your system design diagram!
	- Only add/change things when it’s necessary!
- Tips for defining non-functional requirements.
	- Think about scalability, availability/consistency, and performance, and maybe durability if data persistence is required.
		- **Scalability:** Think about DAU, storage requirements, read/write ratio, requests/second.
		- **Availability/Consistency**: Tradeoffs, eventual/causal/strong consistency.
		- **Durability**: Can we afford to lose data/writes.
- Treat interviewer as a coworker with which you are working with.
	- Provide maximum number of positive data points!
- Call it out when you unsure about something!
- Use function call syntax (`myFunction(params)`) for API level design instead of HTTP requests.

See [[system-design-interview-questions]] for my journey in practicing these questions and giving myself feedback.
